Copy the aws_helper.sh file into your home directory and add `. ~/aws_helper.sh` to the end of your `~/.bash_profile`.
Ensure this is loaded into your current shell by either relogging or running the command `source ~/aws_helper.sh`.

All commands are available via `aws-helper` and support tab completion. Each command supports the `help` subcommand for further information.
See an outline of the commands below.

## Configuration File
If you have a long role name, a combination of account & role name, or any other frequently 
used assume-role command, then you can create aliases to these commands by adding them to the
file `~/.aws-config/config`. These aliases can then be used by running the command
`aws-helper assume-role alias-name`

### Example

```
[long-named-role]
AWSPowerUserWithBillingAccessAndMFAValidationProduction

[role-with-account-id]
